    "### Building an Insurance Coverage Voice Assistant\n",
    "This workshop will guide you through building a voice-enabled insurance policy assistant that helps customers understand their healthcare coverage. We'll take an existing voicebot system and enhance it to become a specialized insurance coverage checker, capable of accessing policy documents and providing accurate coverage information in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workshop Objectives {#objectives}\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you will have built an AI-powered system that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interact naturally with customers using voice\n",
    "- Access and interpret insurance policy documents\n",
    "- Provide accurate coverage information for specific medical services\n",
    "- Maintain a professional and helpful conversation flow\n",
    "- Handle common customer inquiries about healthcare coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**\n",
    "Before starting this workshop, ensure you have:\n",
    "The provided voice interaction system (p1uc1_realtime_api_converse_step2.py) from earlier steps \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each customer's policy is stored in a separate text file using a standardized format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "policy_documents/\n",
    "    └── insurance_policy_[customer_id].txt\n",
    "`\n",
    "First, let's create our policy documents in a specific format. \\\n",
    "Create a folder named policy_documents and save the following files: \\\n",
    "File: policy_documents/insurance_policy_12345.txt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Customer Number: 12345\n",
    "Name: John Smith\n",
    "Policy Type: Premium Health Insurance Plan - AtlasMedical Insurance\n",
    "\n",
    "Coverage Details for Specialist Visits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiologist Visits:\n",
    "- In-network copay: $45\n",
    "- Coverage: 85% after deductible\n",
    "- Pre-authorization required for non-emergency procedures\n",
    "- Referral from primary care physician required\n",
    "\n",
    "Endocrinologist Visits:\n",
    "- In-network copay: $40\n",
    "- Coverage: 90% after deductible\n",
    "- No pre-authorization required for standard visits\n",
    "- Annual diabetes check-ups fully covered\n",
    "\n",
    "General Coverage Terms:\n",
    "- Annual deductible: $1,500\n",
    "- Out-of-pocket maximum: $5,000\n",
    "- In-network coverage: 80-90%\n",

    "## STEP1 - Modify the realtime API Converse Agent to adopt to the new Insurance Coverage Voice Assistant role \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modified System Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will change the basic AI assistant prompt to a specific insurance agent persona so that the instructions now focus on insurance-related interactions and procedures. \\\n",
    "We also need to add specific guidance about collecting customer IDs to match and providing policy information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system now starts with a proper insurance-specific greeting\n",
    "It follows a logical flow: greeting → request ID → get query → provide information\n",
    "Each state has appropriate responses and next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Added Insurance-Specific Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need to integrate a class e.g.AtlasMedicalAgent class which handles insurance policy lookups and interpretation. \\\n",
    "- Add conversation state tracking to remember customer IDs and context.\n",
    "- Included conversation context storage to maintain coherent interactions.\n",
    "- The AI now has detailed instructions about being an insurance agent\n",
    "- It knows to ask for customer ID before providing any policy information\n",
    "- The responses are tailored to insurance queries\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enhanced Response Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modified the text processing to route through our insurance agent.\n",
    "Added handling for insurance-specific queries and responses.\n",
    "Included context updating to maintain conversation flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### State Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "Added tracking for current customer ID.\n",
    "Included conversation context storage for maintaining interaction history.\n",
    "Added support for multi-turn conversations about insurance coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We added a dedicated InsuranceConversationState class\n",
    "This tracks where we are in the conversation\n",
    "It ensures we get necessary information before providing policy details\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enhanced Feedback:\n",
    "\n",
    "The system provides clear status messages about what's happening\n",
    "It confirms when it hears customer ID numbers\n",
    "It guides customers through the process step by step\n",
    "\n",
    "The core audio processing and websocket handling remain unchanged because they're working well. We're primarily adding the insurance-specific logic layer on top of the existing infrastructure.\n",
    "These modifications transform the general-purpose conversation system into a specialized insurance assistant while maintaining all the sophisticated voice processing capabilities of the original system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

Get the real-time API working","text":"<p>In this step-by-step guide formatted as a Jupyter Notebook, we will begin by making a simple API call to the Realtime API and playing back the audio response. This initial step ensures that all underlying resources, such as model deployments, API keys, and endpoints, are correctly configured and functioning as expected. By successfully completing this foundational step, users will have a working baseline that serves as the starting point for building more sophisticated interactions in subsequent sections.</p> <p>At the end of this step we listen to a short story about a robot lost in a busy city told by realtime API.</p>"},{"location":"part1/uc1/uc1/#2-converse-with-the-real-time-api","title":"2. Converse with the real-time API","text":"<p>In this step, we'll transform our single-turn audio generation into a full conversational system. This involves tackling several key challenges: managing bi-directional audio streams for both user input and AI output, implementing proper turn-taking mechanics (knowing when the user has finished speaking and when the AI should respond), handling the complex flow of events from speech detection to response generation, and maintaining conversation context across multiple exchanges. The trickiest part isn't just streaming the audio - it's orchestrating all these components to work together smoothly while maintaining natural conversational flow. We'll build this step by step, focusing on creating a robust system that can handle real-world conversation scenarios.</p>"},{"location":"part1/uc1/uc1/#3-building-the-callcenter-app-our-mvp","title":"3.
